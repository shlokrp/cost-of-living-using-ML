## 🛠️ Methodology & Tech Stack

[cite_start]The model is built on a comprehensive 2022 dataset of goods and services prices[cite: 41]. [cite_start]This data is then backtracked to the year 2000 using historical inflation rates to create a robust time-series database for forecasting[cite: 44].

* [cite_start]**Backend**: Python, Flask [cite: 176]
* [cite_start]**Frontend**: HTML, CSS, JavaScript [cite: 175]
* [cite_start]**Forecasting Models**: ARIMA, SARIMA, Exponential Smoothing, LSTM [cite: 154]
